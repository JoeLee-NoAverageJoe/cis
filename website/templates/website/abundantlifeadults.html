          <p class="lead">
              Jesus said, “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” John 10:10 (KJV).
              Abundant Life Adult Ministries seeks to assist adults in living the abundant life. In order to do so, we believe
              that it is important that men and women have a MISSION in life, so that Tri-County Church of the Nazarene can be
              a church with impact. Abundant Life Adult Ministries connects our adults to mission and purpose. We do this through
              a variety of means.
